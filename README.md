# Raycast-Vector-3D-CPP
"C++ Raycast implementation with 3D vector mathematics and operator overloading"
Description:
Raycast 3D Vector Operations - C++ OOP Project

This C++ project implements a comprehensive 3D vector class (Vector3) with operator overloading for advanced mathematical operations. The project demonstrates raycasting fundamentals by calculating and visualizing direction vectors in a 3D space using proper vector mathematics.

Key Features:
3D Vector Class Implementation: Complete mathematical vector operations in C++

Operator Overloading: Implementation of arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) for vectors

Vector Mathematics: Dot product, cross product, normalization, magnitude calculations

Raycasting Visualization: Generating images through vector direction calculations

Object-Oriented Design: Clean class structure with proper encapsulation

Technical Implementation:
Core Class: Vector3 with x, y, z coordinates

Methods: Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, cross product, normalization

File Structure: Vector3.hpp (header), Vector3.cpp (implementation), main.cpp (testing/demo)

Image Output: Generates visual representation of vector calculations

Learning Outcomes:
Advanced C++ operator overloading techniques

3D vector mathematics implementation

Raycasting algorithm fundamentals

Proper C++ class design and implementation

Mathematical visualization through programmin
